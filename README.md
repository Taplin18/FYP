### Title ###
Location Privacy Tool - A Web Demo

### Abstract ###
Location privacy is a growing issue in cybersecurity. The spatial bloom filter is one of the many privacy-preserving protocols aimed at mitigating this threat to personal privacy. The goal of this project is to develop a graphical web demo that would explain to non-experts what a spatial bloom filter is and how it works. 

The spatial bloom filter is a data structure based on bloom filters, designed to store location information. The protocol keeps the user's exact location hidden but allows the provider of the service to learn when the user is close to specific points of interest or inside predefined areas. At the same time, the points and areas of interest remain oblivious to the user.

This project uses Flask to develop a simple and intuitive web demo to display the spatial bloom filter data structure and the cryptographical protocols used, explaining how the SBF protocol works.
